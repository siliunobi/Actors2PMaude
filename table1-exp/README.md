# Reproducing experimental results in Table 1

This repo consists of both qualitative and quantitative analysis of our extended running example with six different tools.  Go to the corresponding subdirectories **qualitative/** and **quantitative/** (under **query/**), respectively, to reproduce the experimental results in Table 1. 

**Note**: 

 - This set of experiments relies on the third party tools; in particular, the qualitative analysis is performed with [umaudemc](https://github.com/fadoss/umaudemc).
 
 - Each of the directories **qualitative/** and **quantitative/** has a subdirectory **tools_dir/** to put the binaries which are currently not included. There is a **TODO** file with the links to download them (for either  Linux or macOS).
