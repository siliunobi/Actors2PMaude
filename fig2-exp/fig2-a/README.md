# Reproducing experimental results in Figure 2 (a)



- Run **run.sh** on a local machine (this set of experiments (18 data points in total in Figure 2 a) can be quickly finished on a local machine in around one minute).

- The statistical model checking results for delta=_ are shown in output_.txt where results are listed in ascending order of malicious demands (x-axis).

- For reference, **ntube.dat** stores the results obtained on the Emulab cluster 

**Note**:  Do not forget to kill the "pvesta-server.jar" process before performing any new  experiment.
